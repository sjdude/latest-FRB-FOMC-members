# The latest Federal Reserve Bank / FOMC membership by month
This notebook parses the latest information from The Fed [webpage](https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/bios/board/boardmembership.htm) and [FRASER](https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/) and creates a list of FRB/FOMC personnel and their positions by month.

Note:
Accurate from 2006 onwards
Years prior to 2006 contain exceptions to the Federal Bank membership rotations which the membership calculator does not take account for.
